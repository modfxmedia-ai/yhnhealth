 * Two real YHN clinics:
 *   • Merchantville, NJ (Camden County)  — anchors NJ-side cities
 *   • Chalfont, PA     (Bucks County)    — anchors PA-side cities
 *
 * Each city has its own population, ZIPs, neighborhoods, county, and the
 * "nearest" clinic so the generated copy is genuinely localized — not boilerplate.
 *
 * Each service carries condition lists, benefits, FAQs, and process steps
