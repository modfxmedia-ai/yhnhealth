But, in addition to helping our patients with posture and corrective exercises to promote healing, we emphasize diet, regular exercise, sleep, and a positive mindset.\n\nOur culture has become increasingly sedentary. Along with job stress, modern habits can take a toll on both physical and mental health. We see the results. A growing number of younger people are now overweight or obese. The number of people with diabetes and heart problems has grown steadily in the past couple of decades. As a society, we now consume more pills than ever before.

A brisk walk or Modern dance moves are great ways to reap the benefits! Play a game of pickup basketball, or touch football, go canoeing with the family or take up yoga to reap the dual benefits or stretching and meditation.\n\nEat simple meals that are heavy on fruit, vegetables, and fiber; include whole grains, nuts, and legumes. Lessen your dependence on coffee and sweets. Limit alcohol and soda consumption. If you still smoke, quit. Take brown bag lunches to work or school, and skip the drive-through lanes -- your budget will stretch further as well. Cook at home.",
